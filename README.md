## Key Components

### Domain Models

- **Position**: Coordinates with floor information
- **FloorPlan**: Building floor layout with navigation nodes
- **PointOfInterest**: Searchable locations with categories
- **Beacon**: BLE beacon configuration for positioning
- **NavigationPath**: Route with turn-by-turn instructions

### Positioning Engine

- **BeaconScanning**: BLE device detection and RSSI measurement
- **Trilateration**: Calculate position from multiple beacon distances
- **SensorFusion**: Combine positioning data with device sensors
- **PathfindingEngine**: A* algorithm for optimal route calculation

### UI Screens

- **SplashScreen**: App initialization and branding
- **WelcomeScreen**: User onboarding
- **LoginScreen**: Authentication (mock implementation)
- **MapScreen**: Main navigation interface
- **SettingsScreen**: App configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK 24+ (Android 7.0)
- Kotlin 2.1.20+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd IndoorNavigation20
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Sync the project with Gradle files

4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device

### Configuration

The app currently uses mock data for demonstration. To integrate with real systems:

1. **Floor Plans**: Replace mock data in `NavigationRepository` with actual floor plan APIs
2. **BLE Beacons**: Configure real beacon UUIDs, majors, and minors
3. **Authentication**: Implement actual login/registration system
4. **Backend Integration**: Connect to your building management system

## Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles:

- **Presentation Layer**: Compose UI, ViewModels, UI state
- **Domain Layer**: Business models, use cases
- **Data Layer**: Repositories, data sources, caching

### State Management

- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows down, events flow up
- **StateFlow**: Reactive state observation
- **Immutable State**: Predictable state updates

## Positioning Technology

### BLE Beacon Setup

1. Deploy BLE beacons throughout the building
2. Configure beacon positions in the coordinate system
3. Set appropriate transmission power levels
4. Map beacon coverage areas

### Trilateration Algorithm

The app uses distance measurements from multiple beacons to calculate position:

1. Measure RSSI from nearby beacons
2. Convert RSSI to distance using path loss model
3. Apply trilateration with 3+ beacon measurements
4. Filter and smooth position using sensor fusion

## Navigation Algorithm

The A* pathfinding algorithm provides optimal routes:

1. Create navigation graph from floor plan nodes
2. Calculate heuristic costs to destination
3. Find shortest path considering obstacles
4. Generate turn-by-turn instructions
5. Support multi-floor navigation via elevators/stairs

## Material 3 Design

The app leverages Material 3 features:

- **Dynamic Color**: Adapts to system wallpaper colors
- **Large Screens**: Responsive layout for tablets
- **Dark Theme**: Automatic dark/light theme switching
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, large text support

## Future Enhancements

- **Augmented Reality**: AR overlays for navigation guidance
- **Voice Navigation**: Audio turn-by-turn instructions
- **Offline Maps**: Download floor plans for offline use
- **Analytics**: Track popular routes and POIs
- **Admin Panel**: Web interface for building management
- **IoT Integration**: Connect with smart building systems

## Testing

Run tests using:

```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```
